//Task Manager Guidelines
//
//Core Objectives
//The program should display a menu listing all possible actions the user can take. ✔︎
//The User should be able to create new tasks. ✔︎
//The User should be able to see a list of all tasks (Completed and Uncompleted). ✔︎
//The User should be able to see a list of only uncompleted tasks.✔︎
//The User should be able to see a list of only completed tasks. ✔︎
//The User should be able to mark a task as complete. ✔︎
//The User should be able to mark a completed task as incomplete. ✔︎
//The User should be able to delete a task. ✔︎
//The User should be able to exit the program. ✔︎
//The program should include error handling to account for incorrect user input in all areas where user input is required. ✔︎
//
//Extra Challenges
//Add a priority system to Tasks. Tasks should be sorted by the priority in each Task list. ✔︎
//Allow the user to set a custom complete by date for each Task. ✔︎
//    Allow the user to edit an existing Task by changing the title, task details, and complete by date. ✔︎
//    Implement persistence for the app, so that the user’s list of Tasks persists between runs of the application.
//Add easter eggs to the Task Manager! Be creative with these. They could be triggered when a user enters in a specific input, when a user takes a specific series of actions, etc.
//Add a login system to the Task Manager. Have the user enter a password to get into the application whenever it starts up. ✔︎
//
//Task Data Model:
//The Task Data Model should have the following properties:
//Title ✔︎
//Details of task ✔︎
//Completion Status ✔︎
//Complete By Date ✔︎
//
//
//Tips:
//Make sure to be committing regularly and pushing those commits to GitHub! Very handy in case something happens to your computer or you want to go back to a previous version of your application.
//Break the program down into smaller pieces! Thinking about it as “Creating a Task Manager” is a lot harder to think about than “Create a menu and display it”.
//Make sure your code is formatted and commented well!
//


//Format for NSUserDefaults





//Format for dates
let dateFormatter = DateFormatter()
dateFormatter.dateFormat = "MM/dd/yyyy"
let calendar = Calendar.current
let currentDate = Date()
let componetsOfcurrentDate = calendar.dateComponents([.year, .day, .month], from: currentDate)
